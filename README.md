Dragon Generator

A super duper scary dragon generator!

Ok, actually, it's a reactjs tutorial project. :)

# What Is It

This is a demo project, built with ReactJs, that demonstrates how to create a simple app. The demo contains a form, along with code for binding the input fields and processing the form submit. The UI template uses Twitter Bootstrap and Font-Awesome, while the underlying logic uses React javascript and node.js.
